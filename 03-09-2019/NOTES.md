# Hooks

## `useState` Hook
- hooks work only in functional components
- reuse stateful logic between components
- we can extract stateful logic from component
- `useState` hook
  - `useState` returns a pair: _currentState_ and _function_ that lets me update it, we use array descru
  - it **doesn't merge old state with new state** oppose to `class` based approach
  - only argument for `useState` is initialState, the **initialState argument is only used during first render**
