## React

:mortar_board: ```this.setState()```
- has second arg, which takes a callback, the callback is for anything we want to do after state has been changed. (_Lame terms - use it when you want a function to run after a SPECIFIC state has been updated_) When is it useful? When making API call.

## General JS

:mortar_board: ```Object.value()``` - converts object values into array, which we can iterate on

:mortar_board: ```Object.keys()``` - converts object keys into array, which we can iterate on

:mortar_board: ```Object.entries()``` - converts key, value pairs into array each individual array and then puts them all into one array

:mortar_board: ```.filter()``` - is a HOF (higher order function) that __creates new array__ with all elements, and filters the value based on condition we pass it on
