### Scope

- reference, [Notes 13-06-2020](../13-06-2020/NOTES.md)
- two types of scope - local and global scope
- by default we have global scope
- local scope - eg. variables defined inside functions, those variables are bound to the functions
- `switch`, `for`, `while`, `if` **DON'T** create new scope
- block scope is considered everything between curly braces

- keyword `let` and `const` are block scoped, they create local scope do not leak outside and become globaly available variables
